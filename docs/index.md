## Projects

### Prompt Injection Testing
Simulate prompt injection payloads against LLM apps. Log outcomes, visualize risk, and track mitigations.

### Deepfake Detection Engine
Ingest images/videos from social feeds and run them through a detector API. Trend detection by community.

### AI Red Team Simulator
LLM-assisted planning using MITRE ATT&CK to emulate adversary behavior in a sandbox.

### PQC Benchmarking
Measure Kyber/Dilithium/Falcon performance on real devices.
